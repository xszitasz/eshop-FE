This project is a simple webshop application built with Java Spring Boot for the
backend and Angular for the frontend. The application is containerized using Docker
and uses PostgreSQL for data storage. The project includes a CI/CD pipeline for
automated testing, building, and deployment. The backend runs as a JAR file on a local
server (your old laptop), and the Angular frontend is served separately.
